= simple_release_notes

A simple plugin to help release notes process with Redmine.

= Why do we create a plugin?

Because we need an way to automatize
the Release Notes process using something
that search redmine's issues and filter
by a Version especific.

= How it works?

We use some Version Previously Registered
to filter especifcs issues and generate
an oficial Release Notes document using
an specific template.

= Warning

I'm still evolving the code to find a way
to generate totally custom templates. Wich 
doesn't happens today.
